## The Mathematics behind zkSNARKS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRQw2RpQAVc

### Intro (from Youtube)
In this workshop, we review the mathematical principles of verified computing as described in the Pinocchio protocol. The session includes the concepts of circuits, quadratic arithmetic programs and verified computation.

Be prepared for some math! We will do a simple Zero Knowledge Snark from the beginning to the end to understand the fundamentals of Zero Knowledge proofs.

Prerequisites: Participants should have some understanding of zero knowledge proofs, as this workshop will not get into the general theory. Simplified cryptography will be used that requires only basic addition, subtraction and multiplication in finite fields.

About the Presenter: Mirco Richter is a mathematician with an academic background. He has been working and conducting research in the Blockchain space since 2011 with a focus on Cryptography and Consensus Algorithms. He is involved in the cCoin movement and has authored the  accompanying paper: A (somewhat) easy pen & paper example of the Pinocchio protocol (Part 1).

### Intro (from Youtube)
Solana is a fast, cheap, and monstrous blockchain that’s popped up lately. In this video, we talk about some technical stuff of Solana, go over how it was founded, and then explain the tokenomics of the project.
