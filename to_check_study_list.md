### Intro (from Youtube)
In this workshop, we review the mathematical principles of verified computing as described in the Pinocchio protocol. The session includes the concepts of circuits, quadratic arithmetic programs and verified computation.

Be prepared for some math! We will do a simple Zero Knowledge Snark from the beginning to the end to understand the fundamentals of Zero Knowledge proofs.

Prerequisites: Participants should have some understanding of zero knowledge proofs, as this workshop will not get into the general theory. Simplified cryptography will be used that requires only basic addition, subtraction and multiplication in finite fields.

About the Presenter: Mirco Richter is a mathematician with an academic background. He has been working and conducting research in the Blockchain space since 2011 with a focus on Cryptography and Consensus Algorithms. He is involved in the cCoin movement and has authored the  accompanying paper: A (somewhat) easy pen & paper example of the Pinocchio protocol (Part 1).


Many thanks to Electric Coin Co. for supporting this workshop!

Electric Coin Company launched and supports the development of Zcash — a privacy-protecting, digital currency built on strong science. Since its launch in 2016, Zcash has quickly grown to be one of the most valued and admired cryptocurrencies in the world.

Although we discovered the underlying scientific principles and designed the Zcash protocol, we do not control the currency, its mining or its distribution. Every user of Zcash contributes to its decentralization, helping to protect it against failure and corruption. Our team is one among many participants in the network.
